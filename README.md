# Note-App-in-Kotlin
I followed a note app tutorial on YouTube but it was cut short at Add Note. I've taken it upon myself, first of all, to rewrite the thing without the YouTube tutorial in the background, and secondly to rewrite it in Kotlin to learn Kotlin.

Here is the YouTube tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3b5xxb8w7lI

Here is the GitHub repository to the original: https://github.com/bikashthapa01/note-me

I added Edit Note and Delete Note functionality. This is one of my very first projects in Android Studio.

# Note-App-in-Kotlin
I followed a note app tutorial on YouTube but it was cut short at Add Note. I've taken it upon myself to "redo" it, firstly to try and do it without the tutorial, and secondly to rewrite it in Kotlin to learn a bit more about Kotlin.

Here is the YouTube tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3b5xxb8w7lI

Here is the GitHub repository to the original: https://github.com/bikashthapa01/note-me

I added Edit Note and Delete Note functionality. This was a learning experience and is not meant to be anything very functional. This is one of my very first projects in Android Studio.
